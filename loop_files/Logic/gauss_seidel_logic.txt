Logic Breakdown:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Clear the command window (`clc`), clear all variables from the workspace (`clear all`), and close all open figures (`close all`).

2.  **Matrix Setup:**
    *   Define parameters `TX`, `TY`, and `length_of_strip`.
    *   Call an external function `make_the_mom_matrix` with these parameters to get a matrix `the_data`.
    *   Get the size of `the_data` to determine `N`, the size of the linear system.
    *   Extract the `A` matrix (NxN), the `b` vector (Nx1), and `the_locations` vector from `the_data`.

3.  **Exact Solution:**
    *   Calculate the exact solution `exact_x` by taking the inverse of `A` and multiplying it by `b`. This is for comparison purposes.

4.  **Gauss-Seidel Iteration:**
    *   Set the number of iterations `no_of_iterations`.
    *   Initialize the solution vector `x_GS` to zeros.
    *   Start a loop for the specified number of iterations.
    *   Inside the iteration loop, start another loop that iterates through each row of the matrix `A` (from 1 to N).
    *   For each row `ct1`:
        *   Initialize a `sum` variable with the corresponding value from the `b` vector (`b(ct1)`).
        *   Subtract the contributions from the already updated components of `x_GS` in the current iteration (elements `1` to `ct1-1`).
        *   Subtract the contributions from the components of `x_GS` from the *previous* iteration (elements `ct1+1` to `N`).
        *   Update the current component `x_GS(ct1)` by dividing the `sum` by the diagonal element `A(ct1,ct1)`.
    *   Repeat for the specified number of iterations.

5.  **Plotting:**
    *   Create a new figure.
    *   Plot the absolute value of the Gauss-Seidel solution `x_GS` against `the_locations`.
    *   Hold the plot.
    *   Plot the absolute value of the exact solution `exact_x` against `the_locations` with a red dash-dot line.
    *   Turn on the grid.
    *   Add a legend to distinguish the "GS" (Gauss-Seidel) and "Exact" solutions.
    *   Set the title of the plot to indicate the number of Gauss-Seidel iterations.
    *   Label the x and y axes.
